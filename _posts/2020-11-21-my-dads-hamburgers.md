I think I make Pretty Good Hamburgers. My 'recipe' is something my dad taught me. It's simple but effective – there are definitely more-refined burgers out there, but this is the [Keep It Simple](https://wiki.c2.com/?KeepItSimple) way to make a good burger. Follow these instructions:

1. Obtain fresh *80% lean, 20% fat* ground beef.
    * ***450 grams*** (*1 pound*) makes ***4 patties***.
    * ***900 grams*** (*2 pounds*) makes ***7 patties***.
    * The math doesn't make sense, it just is.
2. Separate beef into patties equal sizes according to the guidance above.
    * You don't have to measure this, eyeballing it is fine.
    * Don't over-smush the meat. If you can preserve the grain from how the beef was ground it gives the hamburger a nice texture and, when cooked, it stays together better.
    * Form patties into either a round disc or a square disc.
    * Patties may look a bit large. They shrink when cooked.
    * Use you thumbs to put a noticeable divot in the center of each patty. It helps the patty stay flat as it contracts.
3. Season with [Lawry’s Seasoned Salt](https://www.mccormick.com/lawrys/flavors/spice-blends/seasoned-salt), a thin amount over the entire surface area of both sides.
    * This is the most-noticeable way to affect the flavor of the burger. Too much salt and it's a salty burger. Too little and your burger is bland. You'll want to experiment to find your right amount.
4. Sprinkle about *5 milliliters* (*1 teaspoon*) of Worcestershire sauce on each patty. A couple of good dashes if you're using a sauce dispenser like [Lea & Perrins](https://www.leaperrins.com/)'. This boosts the burger's umami flavor.
    * Some sauce brands have MSG added.
5. Cook it. There's a million different ways out there to cook things; you do you.
    * I like my burgers done *medium-rare*, which is *60º Celsius* or *135º Fahrenheit* internal temperature.
6. You need a bun, find your favorite kind. Place cooked patty in bun.

All other accoutrements such as cheese, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, tomato, etcetera… are like pizza toppings: choose your own flavor adventure.

If you've followed all these steps, you've made a Pretty Good Burger. Congratulations, and enjoy what you've created!
