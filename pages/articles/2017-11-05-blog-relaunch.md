It is __official__ - I have relaunched my blog! It looks a bit trashy at the moment, but it's something I can maintain and improve over time.

## What happened to the old posts?

My old OctoPress-based blog only had six posts!

* Localization of nested attributes in Rails 3.2
* Click events in poltergeist vs capybara-webkit
* How to turn off Dragonfly's default verbose rack-cache
* Speeding up tests that interact with Dragonfly
* Default Hash Values
* Default Hash Values (the RIGHT way)

I have decided that they are old enough that the information is either out-of-date or not valuable enough to carry forward.
You _may_ be able to find those old posts by [browsing soulcutter.com on Archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/*/soulcutter.com/*).
